- __Saves Password (token)__ : you just need to provide it with your username and password once, it will save it and every time you will write `ghb` it will automatically push without asking for credentials
- __Checks For All The Common Pitfalls__ : 
  - checks if the repo is not initilized, it does it
  - if the remote is not added, asks for it
  - if not staged, it does it
  - if not commited, commits 
- __Save Time__ : so you just need to type `ghb` that's it, even if the repo is not initialized. in that way it saves your time by doing the repetative tasks ðŸ˜…

ghb ( gitgub ) is your friendly neighbour to push local repo to github. Automating the repetitive tasks " add, commit, push, username, token, f**K "

# Quick Start

clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/amitanshusahu/ghb && cd ghb
```
give execute permission
```bash
chmod 700 ghb
```
make the script available locally 
```bash
sudo mv ghb /usr/local/bin/
```
